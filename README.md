# Hi, I'm Francesco 

I'm a designer currently working as a **Senior Product Designer** at the [@teamdigitale](https://github.com/teamdigitale) ( the Italian Department for Digital Transformation).

For the past 15 years, I've worked as a digital designer for various companies, ranging from large organizations to small startups, leading teams and projects.

In 2010, I co-founded Robodomain, a software company that created tools and apps for domain management.

As someone who is passionate about design and coding, I'm always excited to take on new challenges and create something truly amazing.
