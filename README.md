# Hi, I'm Francesco 

I'm a Product Designer and CSS+Sass Expert.  

Actually I'm **Senior Product Designer** at [Designers Italia](https://designers.italia.it).

Back in 2010 I fouded **Robodomain**, a software company focused on domains management. In 2013 [DNSimple acquired](https://blog.dnsimple.com/2012/09/dnsimple-acquires-robodomain/) and integrated the software in their product suite. It was such a exciting, difficult but beautiful experience.

Occasionally I write and talk about design methodologies, workflow and tools at conferences and events. I'm lecturer at **UXUniversity** having a [full-day workshop](https://www.uxuniversity.it/11/c_13/design-systems) about **Design Systems and Atomic Design**.
