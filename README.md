# Hi, I'm Francesco 

I am currently employed as a Senior Product Designer at @teamdigitale, Italy's Department for Digital Transformation. 

My role involves curating the **Italian Government Design System** and designing services to improve the **citizen** **experience**.

Over the past 15 years, I have acted as a digital designer for diverse companies, from large organizations to small startups, leading teams and projects.
In 2010, I co-founded Robodomain, a software company that develops tools and apps for domain management.

With a passion for design and coding, I am always eager to embrace new challenges and create something truly extraordinary.
